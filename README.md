Ublu is an interpretive language for remote systems programming of midrange or
mainframe hosts from a Java platform such as Linux, Mac, OpenBSD or Windows.

I wrote Ublu because I wanted a language to run on OpenBSD/Mac/Linux/Windows that
could do systems programming on IBM i Series OS Â®. I was supporting my consulting
clients by writing individual utility programs using JTOpen which I have used
since 1998 to control the AS/400. I decided to consolidate the programs in a
language, and the result is Ublu.

Ublu is Open Source Software under the BSD-2 license.

The user's guide is [userdoc/ubluguide.html] (http://www.softwoehr.com/softwoehr/oss/ubludoc/ubluguide.html)

The full reference is [userdoc/ubluref.html] (http://www.softwoehr.com/softwoehr/oss/ubludoc/ubluref.html)

Here's an [example of Ublu code] (http://www.softwoehr.com/softwoehr/oss/ubludoc/jobstuff-example.html)

The example is syntax-colored using a [jEdit] (http://jedit.org) edit mode provided with Ublu.

The current version of Ublu is 1.1.0

Ublu is distributed with the open source libraries it needs and their license
files which permit such distribution.

Ublu is already a stable and useful tool which has seen much use in the real
world. It is neither complete nor perfect, but what is in this world?
