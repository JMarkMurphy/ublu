Ublu Midrange and Mainframe Life Cycle Extension Language

Ublu is an interpretive language for remote systems programming of midrange or
mainframe host from a Java platform such as OpenBSD, Linux or Windows. It is
already at version 1.0 and is being released as Open Source Software now under
the BSD-2 license. However, the tree has to be reworked from an in-house tool
to an open source tool and that is why some stuff is mysterious or missing to
make it build. I am working on it in my Copious Spare Time to make Ublu's git
repository complete for this already pretty stable and useful tool!
