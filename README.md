## General information</a>

Ublu is an interpretive language for remote systems programming of midrange or
mainframe hosts from a Java platform such as Linux, Mac, OpenBSD or Windows.

I wrote Ublu because I wanted a language to run on OpenBSD/Mac/Linux/Windows that
could do systems programming on IBM i Series OS Â®. I was supporting my consulting
clients by writing individual utility programs using JTOpen which I have used
since 1998 to control the AS/400. I decided to consolidate the programs in a
language, and the result is Ublu.

Ublu is Open Source Software under the BSD-2 license.

The user's guide is [userdoc/ubluguide.html] (http://www.softwoehr.com/softwoehr/oss/ubludoc/ubluguide.html)

The full reference is [userdoc/ubluref.html] (http://www.softwoehr.com/softwoehr/oss/ubludoc/ubluref.html)

Here's an [example of Ublu code] (http://www.softwoehr.com/softwoehr/oss/ubludoc/jobstuff-example.html)

The example is syntax-colored using a [jEdit] (http://jedit.org) edit mode provided with Ublu.

The latest release version of Ublu is 1.1.1

The tip of the master branch calls itself 1.1.1+ as we head for 1.1.2

Ublu is distributed with the open source libraries it needs and their license
files which permit such distribution.

Ublu is already a stable and useful tool which has seen much use in the real
world. It is neither complete nor perfect, but what is in this world?
