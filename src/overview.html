  <h2>Overview</h2>

  <p>The Ublu project is a class library which assists Absolute
  Performance, Inc.'s team in supporting data management and
  operations with regard to midrange and mainframe computing. It
  also contains support for Postgres and MSSQL database
  operations.</p>

  <p>The library includes an interpreter for accessing the library
  as a command application by issuing a string of commands on the
  command line, or by entering commands interactively, or by piping
  input to <code class="western">stdin</code>.</p>

  <p>There is also a TCP/IP listener/server which can serve up the
  interpretive facilities of Ublu over a network connection in
  support of web applications</p>

  <p>The source for this NetBeans-structured project is found in
  the repository <code class=
  "western">https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu.git</code></p>

  <p>The Main class is ublu.Ublu which launches interpreter
  interprets the commands. Assuming <font face=
  "Liberation Mono, monospace">ublu.jar</font> resides in a
  directory with its ancillary open source support libraries
  residing in a <tt class="western"><font face=
  "Liberation Mono, monospace">lib</font></tt> subdirectory,
  <tt class="western">main</tt> can be invoked via:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <code class="western">java -jar ublu.jar</code> <i>commands
    ...</i>
  </blockquote>

  <h2>Notes on the code</h2>

  <h3>Some naming conventions</h3>

  <p>Variable names are as informative as we can make them, e.g.,
  <code class="western">tableNameList</code> or <code class=
  "western">columnTypeNameList</code>. Where <code class=
  "western">aBC</code> is this sort of descriptive variable name
  then:</p>

  <ul>
    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><code class=
      "western">getABC()</code> and <code class=
      "western">setABC()</code> are simple getter-setters.</p>
    </li>

    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <p style="margin-bottom: 0in"><code class=
      "western">generateABC()</code> does work to get data suitable
      for a <code class="western">setABC()</code> operation</p>
    </li>

    <li style="list-style: none; display: inline">
      <p><code class="western">fetchABC()</code> or <code class=
      "western">fetchAParticularInstanceOfABC()</code> will
      generally <code class=
      "western">setTheParticularABCInstance(generateABC())</code>
      .</p>
    </li>
  </ul>
