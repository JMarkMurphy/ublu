.SH DESCRIPTION
.B ublu
is a bash/ksh shell script which launches the Ublu Midrange and Mainframe Life
Cycle Extension Language (http://github.com/jwoehr/ublu) which is a Java
program.

The ublu.jar file must be installed and Ublu's lib directory must be
present and populated, either in the default layout:

/opt/ublu +
          | ublu.jar
          | lib/ +
                 |
.I liba.jar
                 |
.I libb.jar
                 | ...

or elsewhere and specified in an ublu class path passed to the
.B -u
option of the ublu launcher script.

If the
.B -w
option is passed without the (optional) name of a properties file, the
.B --
option ender must be provided before any arguments intended to be passed to Ublu
itself. This option ender must also be used before any dashed options intended
for Ublu itself appear on the command line.

After the shell script options on the command line are exhausted (or ended via
the option ender
.BR -- )
all further arguments are passed to Ublu itself, options and/or commands.

.B ublu
exits with a return code of:
.IP \(bu 4
the return value of Ublu execution if Ublu is successfully invoked
.IP \(bu
-2 if there is an error in invocation
.IP \(bu 
0 if
.B -h
or
.B --help
is invoked.

.SH OPTIONS

.TP
.BI CLASSPATH= "path1:path2" ...
Provide before invocation a Java classpath accessible to Ublu while it executes.
Ublu allows interactive calls into Java libraries so this is a means to make
sure these libraries are findable from within Ublu.

This is a "pre-option" processed by the shell, not the script, and must precede
on the command line the invocation of the ublu shell script.

.TP
.BR -h " or " --help
issues as usage message and exits with a return code of 0.

.TP
.BI -X xopt
Passes a Java -X option to the JVM. The option must not provide an extra leading
"X" itself; correct is, e.g. -X ms512m or -Xms512m

This option can be used multiple times.

.TP
.BI -D " prop=val"
Pass a Java property=value pair to the JVM. Ublu respects several properties
itself, refer to the Ublu Reference.

This option can be used multiple times.

.TP
.BI -u " ubluclasspathelement1:" ...
If Ublu is not installed in /opt/ublu with its support libraries in
/opt/ublu/lib the locations of each element must be passed in the classpath.
Use the -u option to pass all these (multiple) elements in one option.

.TP
.BI -w " [propertiesfilepath]"
Invokes Ublu in a Swing window with an optional properties file. See the Ublu
Reference for a description of Ublu windowing mode and its optional properties
file.

If the
.B -w
option is passed without the (optional) name of a properties file, the
.B --
option ender must be provided before any arguments intended to be passed to Ublu
itself.

.TP
.B --
ends shell script option processing. All further options and arguments
are passed to Ublu itself.
