  <h2>Who is this Guide for?</h2>It's for people who have
  downloaded and built Ublu, read enough of the <a href=
  "ubluref.html">Ublu Reference</a> to know how to launch <a href=
  "https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu">Ublu</a>, and now want an
  introduction to using Ublu.

  <h2>Why Ublu?</h2>I wrote Ublu because I wanted a language to run
  on OpenBSD/Mac/Linux/Windows that could do systems programming
  on&nbsp; IBM i Series OS &#194;&#174;. It is convenient to
  operate legacy systems from modern environments. This empowers
  help desk folks who know how to feed arguments to scripts and
  answer interactive prompts but are challenged by the green
  screen. Intermediate programmers take to Ublu as well as a cheap
  entr&#195;&#169;e to legacy systems programming.<br>
  <br>
  I supported business clients by writing individual programs using
  <a href="http://jt400.sourceforge.net/">JTOpen</a> which I have
  used since the 1990's to control the AS/400 and decided to
  consolidate.&nbsp; I also had previously written a bridge in Java
  to IBM z/VM &#194;&#174; System Management API <a href=
  "https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB27U_6.3.0/com.ibm.zvm.v630.dmse6/toc.htm?lang=en">
  (SMAPI)</a> called <a href=
  "http://pigiron.sourceforge.net/">PigIron</a> and wanted to hook
  that in somehow.<br>
  <br>
  I considered using my <a href="http://fiji.sourceforge.net/">FIJI
  ForthIsh Java Interpreter</a> which works very well but is quite
  arcane for others to use.<br>
  <br>
  <a href="http://www.oorexx.org/">ObjectRexx</a> is a wonderful
  language but it doesn't run on as many platforms as Java.<br>
  <br>
  Other extant language frameworks exist but each has its own
  issues.<br>
  <br>
  So I made up a new language and coded it in Java on top of other
  open source libraries.<br>
  <br>
  Ublu is easy to build, install, and use. It is handsome but not
  beautiful. It's easy to read. It works as an interactive shell
  scripting language but also has some advanced language features
  such as tasking, debugging and a TCP/IP port server mode.<br>
  <br>
  I hope you find Ublu useful!<br>

  <h2>How does Ublu work?</h2>Ublu is an interpreter with full
  language features such as flow control (<tt>IF ELSE DO WHILE</tt>
  etc.) and even a multitasker and debugger.<br>
  <br>
  Ublu has commands that manipulate Java objects representing
  objects, services and various facilities on the remote server. In
  Ublu you can define functions to create complex programs to
  manipulate the remote server and its databases, tape drives,
  whatever. You can also do <a href=
  "http://www.postgresql.org/">Postgresql</a> databasing (and
  pretty much anything&nbsp; else) on your local computer, allowing
  you to interoperate databases with the remote server. You can do
  this interactively or load a program from text files which can,
  in turn, <tt>include</tt> other text files.<br>
  <br>
  When you've got a complete application written in Ublu, there's
  an Ublu command <tt>gensh</tt> which autogenerates and writes out
  a shell script which works under either bash or ksh to take
  arguments via command-line switches and pass them to your
  program's top-level function.<br>
  <br>
  For a formal summary of everything, see the <a href=
  "ubluref.html">Ublu Reference</a>. That Reference tells you how
  to install and run Ublu and lists the Open Source project
  dependencies as well as documenting every command and facility
  built into Ublu.<br>
