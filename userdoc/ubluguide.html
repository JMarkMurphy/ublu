    <h2>Who is this Guide for? </h2>
    It's for people who have downloaded and built Ublu, read enough of
    the <a href="ubluref.html">Ublu Reference</a> to know how to launch
    Ublu, and now want an introduction to using Ublu.
    <h2>Why Ublu?</h2>
    I wrote <a href="https://github.com/jwoehr/ublu">Ublu</a> because I
    wanted a language to run on OpenBSD/Mac/Linux/Windows that could do
    systems programming on&nbsp; IBM i Series OS ®.<br>
    <br>
    I was supporting clients by writing individual programs using <a
      href="http://jt400.sourceforge.net/">JTOpen</a> which I have used
    since the 1990's to control the AS/400 and decided to consolidate.<br>
    <br>
    I also had written a bridge in Java to IBM z/VM ® System Management
    API <a
href="https://www.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SSB27U_6.3.0/com.ibm.zvm.v630.dmse6/toc.htm?lang=en">(SMAPI)</a>
    called <a href="http://pigiron.sourceforge.net/">PigIron</a> and
    now provide support in Ublu for SMAPI via PigIron.<br>
    <h2>How does Ublu work?</h2>
    I made up a language and coded it in Java on top of other open
    source libraries. It sort of makes sense. I could have used extant
    language frameworks but I didn't want to spend my time understanding
    someone else's framework.<br>
    <br>
    Ublu is easy to use, handsome but not beautiful, easy to understand
    and read quickly. It looks like a scripting language but has some
    advanced language features such as tasking, debugging and a TCP/IP
    port server mode.<br>
    <br>
    For a formal summary of everything, see the <a href="ubluref.html">Ublu






      Reference</a>. That Reference tells you how to install and run
    Ublu and lists the Open Source project dependencies along with every
    command built into Ublu.<br>
